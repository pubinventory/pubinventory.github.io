Some pages look by default beautiful in mobile (in Chrome at least) without having to do anything special. It seems github pages work nicely on mobile by default except... when you have a long link :(
In that case, the width of the page becomes super long and the viewport is not recognized as a mobile one. A shame...

This is an example link that triggered this behaviour:

And some lore ipsum to complete, because the post is not long enough :)
